## PROBLEM SOLVING

write a program that takes a book's title, author, number of pages and whether the user has read the book or not
in a form filled on screen. The info is then used to create a new book object, which in turn would be stored in
a book array. Each array element would then be displayed on screen books section.

## Plan

The Library will have a very simple user interface.
Users will fill form information about the book,
and on submission, the book will be the displayed on book display screen.

## PSEUDOCODE

The algorithm in this code includes:
A "add a new book" button would be clicked to reveal a form to be filled. The form should include the book title,author,
number of pages, and whether itâ€™s been read or not. All fields are required, with the read or not is by default on NOT READ.
On form submit, a new object would be created, and added to the array.
The array is looped and each element is therefore displayed on the screen as a card.
